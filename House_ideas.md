## 1st Floor. 
*(This is how we imagine it, but it is negotiable and changeable)*

The main concept is many storage spaces, built-in storage, built-in
plumbing, logical placement, navigation inside the house. High ceilings.
Easy to live, easy to clean. Without useless empty, unused space.

The **main entrance hall** is a small room/corridor with a chest of
drawers, a mirror and a separate room with a system of closets for
storing outdoor and seasonal clothes, shoes, bags.

You can also get to the toilet from the entrance corridor.

Walking along the corridor we come across the stairs to the 2nd floor.

The stairs divide the first floor into 2 zones.

- Zone 1 is the Living Room and Kitchen.

- Zone 2 is the Home Office and Laundry room.

### Zone 1 - Living room and Kitchen.

**The living room** is a spacious room with a TV area, a sofa, and enough
space for a Christmas tree.

**Kitchen**

- Separate storage room. (it would be great if the storage room could be
accessed from the Garage, perhaps not directly from the Garage, but
through some intermediate room or corridor).

- Cooking area.

- Kitchen island.

- Dining table (if possible).

- Access to the outdoor veranda, perhaps through a storage room? Or not.

The kitchen and living room can be combined, partially isolated or
completely isolated. The kitchen pantry is isolated from the kitchen.

### Zone 2 is the Home Office and Laundry room.

- Laundry room. (can be moved to the 2nd floor) With space for storing household chemicals and cleaning equipment. Place
for washing machine, dryer. Ironing area. With a sink.

- Home office. Shelves for books, documents, 2 computer tables, a folding sofa.

## 2nd Floor

- 3 bedrooms 1 large bathroom. Master bedroom with separate dressing room.
Each bedroom has a place for TV.

- Space for a desk (for makeup or studying).

**1 room** - guest room, with space for 2 single beds.

**All rooms** have space for built-in wardrobes (an exception is the master
bedroom, as there is a separate dressing room.)

In the **bathroom**, a place for a shower, a place for a bath, 2 sinks.

Storage cabinet space.

**What definitely won\'t suit us:**

 - A large number of small windows in one room. Better one, but a normal
size. We plan to install an electric convector under each window to
avoid «crying windows».

- Sink on kitchen island.

- \"Second light\" or window on 2 floors. Since this is a loss of
potentially useful space and is difficult to clean.

- Balcony on the second floor.

## Outdoor veranda

it would be great if the veranda was divided into three zones:

- cooking micro zone with sink

- dining table

- sitting area (sofa/armchairs)

## Small garden

## Swimming pool

### Place for pool and tech equipment


### Outdoor toilet and small shower, changing room.

## Engineering

- Solar panels

- Warm floor on first floor and all the bathrooms

- Warm wall in bathroom

- Toilet and tap installations.

- Water isolated basement

- Sound isolation

- For discussion: outside window blinds -- what options do we have?
- Electical wires in bathrooms
